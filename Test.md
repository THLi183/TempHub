In this article, a meshless numerical scheme, which combines the generalized finite difference method (GFDM) and the fictitious-nodes technique, is adopted for two-dimensional boundary value problems (BVPs) governed by high-order partial differential equations (PDEs) of nth order, where n is an even number and  . In such problems, the derivation of high-order partial derivatives is rarely discussed because of the difficulty by adopting the traditional mesh-based method. At the same time, multiple boundary conditions are needed, which lead to an overdetermined system, and may result in unstable numerical solutions. Therefore, a meshless method, GFDM, is proposed, which is employed from Taylor series expansion, and the high-order partial derivatives terms can be easily expressed as a linear combination of functional values and weighting coefficients. The multiple boundary conditions for BVPs are solved with the fictitious-nodes technique, sets of fictitious nodes are distributed outside the computational domain, and then, combine the GFDM to form a well-determined system, which can be solved stably and accurately. Four numerical examples of BVP governed by different orders of PDEs are presented to verify the feasibility of the proposed numerical scheme.
